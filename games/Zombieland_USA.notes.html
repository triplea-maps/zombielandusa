<br> ZombielandUSA created by BigCat (original zombieland by pulicat):<ul>
<br> The USArmy can now get income by capturing certain cities (national objectives). The USArmy has fuel supply limitations and territories, and planes that now run on fuel. Smart Zombies might want to take or destroy the USArmys fuel supply territories or fuel trucks. Trucks now supply 1 fuel per turn at the end of the turn but can still move 3 and blitz in combat. Non-stealth bombers or helicopters can transport troops or artillery, on combat or non-combat turns.    
<br> 
<br><font size="5"> Overview </font>
</b>
<br>
<br> The Map itself, the number of units, and their locations remain the same, but pretty much everything else has been added or corrected as necessary.</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br> Humans:<ul>
<li> USArmy (human player or AI)
<li> CitizensMilitia (AI, or human)
<li> (Hard AI plays an excellent CitizensMilitia, a position of tedious tactics, reduce CitizensMilitia to Medium AI for a more challenging game against the AI zombies)</ul>
<br>
<br> Zombies:<ul>
<li> GreenZombies (human player or AI)
<li> BrownZombies (human player or AI)
<li> GrayZombies (human player or AI)
</ul>
<br> Neutrals:<ul>
<li> Neutrals (AI only, passive position)
</ul>

<br>
<br>Rules of Engagement:<ul><!-- all prose by BigCat except 3 lines by pulicat as noted below)-->
<li> This is the APOCALYPSE so expect MASSIVE losses on BOTH sides during the first few turns, til things settle down.
<li> This game is not for the faint of heart (losing 100 or more units on the 1st turn is normal), strike and counter strike.
<li> Zombies may kill 60 units and only lose 6, USArmy counter strike of cannonfodder and airpower may kill 50 and only lose 5.
<li> In The END, There Can Be ONLY ONE.</ul>


<li> Neutrals are passive (they have no turns).
<li> Trucks can blitz, move 3 and supply 1 fuel per turn; Tanks and halftracks can blitz if paired with a truck.
<li> Trucks and tanks can transport 1 infantry or 1 special forces.
<li> Non-stealth Bombers can transport 1 infantry or 1 special forces.
<li> Helicopters give artillery support and can transport 1 infantry, or 1 special forces, or 1 artillery.
<li> Humans collect income through national objectives rather than map income.
<li> You can build in any territory you own, upto the production value (invisible factories in all the lands).
<li> Purchase and place units comes before movement phase. <!-- this line pulicat-->
<li> There is no home territory. No such thing as liberating allied territory. Whatever you take becomes yours. <!-- this line by pulicat-->
<li> Zombies may produce in newly captured territory. <!-- this line by policat -->
<li> Kansas City, Denver, Salt Lake City, and the Great Basin are now connected by road for reduced movement cost.
<li> Better to attack than be attacked. When in doubt, shoot first, ask questions later. </ul>
 
<br>
<br><b>Good luck!</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>Zombie Notes:<ul>
<li> Juggernauts can blitz, move 2, and carry 1 zombieling.
<li> Ghouls receive +1 on attack and defense vs 1/1 freedom fighters (low strength unit)

<li> Ghouls give bonuses to zombielings, undead, and mutants if stacked with them (+1 to die roll on attacks or extra roll on defense)
<li> For zombling: 1 ghoul = 1 extra defence roll and is unaffected by artillery tech.
<li> For undead or mutant: 1 ghoul = +1 to attack die roll for 1 undead or 1 mutant and Is affected by artillery tech. 

<li> USArmy can be quite good at wiping out unsuspecting zombie stacks, with cannon fodder and air assault.
<li> Zombie_hunters are particulary effective, especially in numbers, not to be underestimated.
 
<li> Better to Eat than be Eaten. When in doubt Eat First and ask questions later. </ul>
               
<br>
<br><b>Good luck!</b>
<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Research, Rumors and Changes:<ul>
<li> Zomblings get +1 on offense when 2 or more zomblings are stacked together.
<li> Undead get +1 on offense when 2 or more undead are stacked together. 
<li> Undead get an extra die roll on defense when 2 or more undead are stacked together.
<li> No strength or Zero strength units (0/0 trucks) give bonuses to some zombie types: Ghouls, Juggernauts, and Mutants.
<li> Each Truck will give one Ghoul an extra die roll on defense upto the number of trucks encountered.
<li> Each Truck will give one Juggernaut +1 and an extra die roll on offense and defense upto the number of trucks encountered.
<li> Each Truck will give one Mutant an extra die roll on defense upto the number of trucks encountered. 
<li> Mutants now cost Fuel instead PUs; a zombieling must also be consumed to place the Mutant.</ul>
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>Other Stuff:<ul>
<li> Zombies generate more zombies and more zombies and more zombies. This is represented by map income.
<li> Humans have no such income, so they have to make do with what they have.
<br>
<li> Small amounts of income can be generated from capturing certain Round cities (national objectives).
<li> Zombies receive a one time bonus of 2 PUs from capturing a Round city. (but only the ones the other side started the game with)
<li> The CitizensMilitia receives 1 PU each turn from a captured Round city (city now pink), but only from the ones that the other side started the game with.
<li> The USArmy receives 4 PUs each turn from a captured Round city (city now blue), but only from the ones that the other side started the game with.

<br>
<br>
<li> Some Round cities and the Great Basin still have roads between them at movement cost = 1 each.
<li> Kansas City, to Denver, to Salt Lake City, to Great Basin, forms a straight line road East to West.</ul>

<br>Fuel Facts:<ul>
<li> Helicopters use 1 fuel per move, Bombers and Fighters use 2 fuel per move, Stealth bombers use 3 fuel per move.
<li> Trucks supply 1 fuel per turn at the end of the turn; only regular territories supply fuel (round cities don't supply fuel).
<li> Texas, North Dakota, and Louisianna territories generate 25 fuel each, California territories and territories that share a border with Texas or Louisianna generate 5 fuel each and all others generate 3 fuel each except Wyoming and Colorado which generate 5 each.
<li> USArmy starts with 605 Fuel and 605 fuel income (variable from territories) and also receives fuel income from trucks.
<li> USArmy receives 1 fuel for each truck at the end of the turn for logistic efficiencies.</ul>

<br>
<br>
<br>News from the Front:<ul>
<li> This is a fight for the species, its a matter of numbers, the other side needs less.
<li> Better to Eat than be Eaten. When in doubt Eat First, and eat the one asking questions later.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Good luck!</b></ul>
<br>
<br>


<br>Improvements/Additions:<ul>
<li> -added zombie bonuses and Fuel use for game balance and interest
<li> -added Fuel supply strategy issue to attempt to remedy USArmy overwhelming air power issue, and because it wasn't much fun to be a zombie.
<li> -removed Chuck Norris air power for same reason above.
<li> -added source of income for USArmy because the AI needed it, and for game balancing.</ul>

<br>
<li> -CREDIT to VEQRYN for the examples and the information on how to do things found in:(pact_of_steel_2 A MOD of original POS by VEQRYN version 3.8) and also (Europe 1940 SeaLion Balanced Mod by Veqryn version=2.6)
<li> -credit to maker of the original zombieland and map pulicat
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>Notable Issues ZombielandUSA version corrects:<ul>
<li> - issue with AI keeping 70 units in center of map the whole game and the AI losing because of it.
<li> - issue with AI destroying itself by ploughing through Neutral territories.
<li> - issue of not being able to pick-up or drop-off paratroops.
<li> - issue of factories sometimes disappearing, dispite the fact they're invisable.</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<li> The game should be good to go. The income of USArmy can be adjusted by using a bid for the USArmy, or by changing the 4 PU Round City Capture bonus, to a different amount, up or down in the xml.
<li> If you don't want the city capture bonus income for any players just deselect national objectives under options at start-up.</ul>


<li> The computer AI is probably better at playing zombies, since TripleA AI does not make use of trucks or planes to load and unload troops.
<li> A Human player playing USArmy with CitizensMilitia on Hard AI, against Medium AI zombies should be able to win, with repeated games, if not the 1st time.
<li> A Human player playing USArmy with CitizensMilitia on Medium AI against the zombies is going to have more of a challenge. At Medium level AI, CitizensMilitia does not "clean-up" after the Big strikes that the USArmy does with its air power.
<li> Of course, the clean-up or mop-up operations may not go as planned and the zombies might get outta hand, or foot, and maybe an arm or leg too.</ul>
